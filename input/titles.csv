"Q - Has Robinhood put a limit on Silver?
A - No. 

There you go, not a squeeze. 

Not a financial advisor."
"CFDs come with the warning, “75% (I forget the exact number) lose money trading CFDs”. Why not just post a similar warning here against volatile stocks if they were genuinely interested in mitigating risk?

This should tell you everything you need to know; they know there is PLENTY more money to be made in this, as people flock to other ‘GME-like’ stocks. We’re seeing exactly the same situation as we’ve seen with TSLA and anything EV related. BB, NOK, AMC are all perfect examples of that. Whether they are good investments or not, the hysteria to ride the next rocket is real. 

Big money is scared about volatility when it isn’t them controlling it and retail investors are taking the blame. How about you look to what started this problem in the first place, as to how a stock is allowed to be shorted 138% and wipe out a perfectly decent company, employing thousands? But no, instead, it’s “those damn kids on Reddit manipulating the market.” 

Heaven forbid hedge funds actually face the consequences for their own actions and greed."
MAIL THE PRESIDENT. CONTACT YOUR SENATORS. DO NOT STOP UNTIL THESE HEDGE FUNDS AND ROBINHOOD ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE NASDAQ CEO SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR MARKET MANIPULATION AND FRAUD. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEMS AND BIDEN TO STEP UP AND SHOW THEY REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. WE DEMAND ACTION.
"What? I just read a huge ass DD post on reddit here last week why Silver is the most shorted / manipulated thing ever. How the hell is that the medias fault reporting about all these 'squeeze Silver' posts here by redditors?

I mean sometimes people just don't even look at where info came from. Then they are pissed if media doesn't report about something and now they are pissed that they are reporting about it."
