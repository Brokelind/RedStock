Considering buying Pfizer
"Meanwhile they still can’t make or sell EVs at scale, won’t be able to make them profitable until at least 2025, have a pile of debt in car loans that risks default heading into recession, can’t scale an EV production line to save their lives literally… 

If you’re buying GM stock for the longterm rn you deserve what’s to come"
"Also that 61% growth you have there includes their China brands for sure, in the US they hardly grew. Buick actually declined heavily.

Their China mini EV sells extremely well, but GM only makes $14 per sale… they could sell millions and it adds nothing but market share"
Netflix misses earnings by 73%… what now?
$SAVA (Cassava Sciences) Alzheimer's Drug Full DD
"Amazon will certainly need another round with at least  10% layoffs for sure. Amazon is barely profitable and they only cut 3% after a huge hiring spree since mid 2020 and revenue growth has slowed to single digits. Google, Microsoft, meta are all more profitable and laid off more than Amazon in terms of %."
"The earlier the better, make it a habit to invest money you’d otherwise spend on things you don’t really need in tandem with building an emergency fund. Go to r/dividends to get an understanding on long term compound investing. 

Another thing I did when I was getting started, since I was around your age and didn’t have much money to invest, was to download a stock tracker app and just simulated like I had more money invested. read up on a bunch of companies and do some DD and you’ll pretty quickly realize trends, sentiments in the market, and it’ll prepare you for risk management and give you a taste of the psychological side of trading and investing. I found it much easier to start trading this way :)"
"If you can afford to, do it immediately.

If you're concerned about the market crashing, you could always deposit money, initially invest it in a ultra short T bill fund to get ~4% interest, and then DCA into your desired allocation over the course of the year.

Also if you have a 401k/403b, that is effectively DCA every month, so you still can benefit if the market crashes."
So glad I bought into DIS & AMZN when they were like $80 over Xmas
"What a surprise, doomers wrong about Netflix implosion and market still looking strong."
