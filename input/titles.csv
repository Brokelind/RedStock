"If Robinhood is SO concerned with the trading volume, why not just restrict day trading to minimize the quick buy then sells?  Oh, because that would keep everyone holding their shares and benefit us and not the hedge funds. How silly of me to forget. TOTALLY a volume concern though and definitely not a ‚Äúhelp the hedge funds‚Äù issue. üôÑ"
"The SEC is there to protect retail investors and right in front of them there is clear market manipulation. Retail investors driving the price up of a stock is not market manipulation, IT IS the market. A large group of people buying and selling stocks isn't manipulation...ITS JUST A MARKET. You can only manipulate the market if you are in the minority.

Your vote with your wallet means more than any political vote ever will."

"CFDs come with the warning, ‚Äú75% (I forget the exact number) lose money trading CFDs‚Äù. Why not just post a similar warning here against volatile stocks if they were genuinely interested in mitigating risk?

This should tell you everything you need to know; they know there is PLENTY more money to be made in this, as people flock to other ‚ÄòGME-like‚Äô stocks. We‚Äôre seeing exactly the same situation as we‚Äôve seen with TSLA and anything EV related. BB, NOK, AMC are all perfect examples of that. Whether they are good investments or not, the hysteria to ride the next rocket is real. 

Big money is scared about volatility when it isn‚Äôt them controlling it and retail investors are taking the blame. How about you look to what started this problem in the first place, as to how a stock is allowed to be shorted 138% and wipe out a perfectly decent company, employing thousands? But no, instead, it‚Äôs ‚Äúthose damn kids on Reddit manipulating the market.‚Äù 

Heaven forbid hedge funds actually face the consequences for their own actions and greed."
"I‚Äôm 16, lost ¬£600 i‚Äôd been saving for a while now lol. I‚Äôm not really salty about it or anything though, i know in the long run that isn‚Äôt a huge amount of money, even if it seems like it now. I‚Äôm glad i was on board though - i learned a valuable lesson that will stick with me for the rest of my trading life. To a noob like me, the DD seemed sound and what they were saying made a lot of sense. It still makes sense to me, even though i‚Äôm not sure where it all went wrong. I imagine there‚Äôll be posts to explain the situation and why what happened happened. In the end, i‚Äôm more just sorry for those that bet their life savings on this, remortgaged their house and shit."
"This should actually be a good thing. Just because you weren‚Äôt aware of market manipulation doesn‚Äôt mean it wasn‚Äôt there. With what‚Äôs happened this week, we showed the dickhead hedge funds to think twice before trying their shit again. I always remember my father and grandfather telling me not to invest in stocks because the whole thing was a game for those at the top. But maybe with the way things are going this will change and the stock market and will once again become a tool for investing. I doubt we will see any big changes aside from hedge funds taking it easy on shorts for a while but it is really cool to see our generation come together from across the world to fight the bad guys. A lot of us that made money on GameStop are going to donate it back to start trying to reverse the damage these fuckhead hedgefund retards have done over the years"
They still have enough big players invested in them to succeed that provides them influence to not get pinched. The moment they F that up you will see them litigated to death.

We are smart enough to handle our own risk!"
"Everyone skeptical about the short squeeze either joined in late and are salty, are sweating about the red, and/or are bots/hedge fund cronies. We're still winning and we have discounts at every dip. VW had a 6 day downward trend then rose every day into the infinite squeeze. These are all scare tactics for the institutions to get paper hands to sell. They're also causing short ladders to trip us out. The short squeeze was going to start last Thursday and the reason it didn't was because of the market manipulation happening behind the scenes with Melvin, Citadel, and Robinhood. Now it's a battle of attrition on who decides to stay in the fight longer, diamond hands or the hedge funds bleeding out billions a day.

You realize every news outlet is spreading propaganda on how GME is over or to move to silver? You realize how many bots are in WSB and stock subreddits shilling and spamming the downfall of GME? A lot. These shit stains have no objections breaking law after law as long as they can mitigate the losses that they take. They'll lobby brokers to sell peoples shares at losses without their permission, infiltrate and spread propaganda, spread false narratives on the news while slipping them money under the table, etc...

The point is they're trying to break your diamond hands in a battle of attrition. As soon as you sell at a loss, you've played into their corrupt system.

Hold throughout the storm and fight."
HOLD WE‚ÄôRE FINE. THEY‚ÄôRE TRYING TO SCARE US TO SELL BECAUSE THEY‚ÄôRE SCARED. WE ARE WINNING üöÄüöÄüöÄ
"I wouldn't blame this all on $GME and WSB. You should do your own DD before YOLOing into any position. I do understand that the media promoting WSB last week, and massively increasing traffic, has made several people with little to no trading experience YOLO into GME in its previous peak, who are probably disspapointed at the recent dip.  

Without going into how not everyone believes $GME is over, its not WSB's fault that they have loads of retards joining in last week only for the hype, when most of WSB got in around $20-30. Not $GME's fault either.  

Either way, yes your lesson is correct to not YOLO on bubbles or short term trends, without doing your own DD. I wish you future tendies King."

"**Sign the petition here: https://www.change.org/p/u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission-sec-retail-investors-demand-market-transparency-please-sec-amend-form-13f-requirements**


Retail Investors demand more visibility into institutional trading and borrowing. Anyone investing over 1 billion dollars (i.e. hedge funds and other investment institutions) is required to disclose their holdings to promote transparency in our markets - it's called Form 13-F. **But did you know that they only need to disclose it 4 times a year? And did you know that they don't need to disclose all of their positions?**


We the people are asking for a re-evaluation of transparency requirements for Institutional Investors. We have access to technology and data gives us new sophistication - and are beginning to understand there is a tremendous disparity in access between retail and institutional investors, and are concerned that this access is being used against us, in ways that we genuinely worry could be in flagrant violation of Securities Laws. We believe that with better access to institutional trading data, retail investors can better participate in the market when making buying and selling decisions.


**According to Form 13F (https://www.sec.gov/files/form13f.pdf), Institutional Investors only need to disclose their positions 4 times a year. Why?**


*Filing of Form 13F. A Manager must file a Form 13F report with the Commission within 45 days after the end of each calendar year and each of the first three calendar quarters of each calendar year. As required by Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act, a Manager which is a bank, the deposits of which are insured in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, must file with the appropriate regulatory agency for the bank a copy of every Form 13F report filed with the Commission pursuant to this subsection by or with respect to such bank. Filers who file Form 13F electronically can satisfy their obligation to file with other regulatory agencies by sending (a) a paper copy of the EDGAR filing (provided the Manager removes or blanks out the confidential access codes); (b) the filing in electronic format, if the regulatory agency with which the filing is being made has made provisions to receive filings in electronic format;*


**In your FAQ (https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/13ffaq.htm), it is clear Institutional Investors are not required to disclose short positions. Why?**


*Question 41
Q: What about short positions?
A: You should not include short positions on Form 13F. You also should not subtract your short position(s) in a security from your long position(s) in that same security; report only the long position.*


**Contact the SEC and let them know retail investors demand increased transparency (https://www.sec.gov/contact-information/sec-directory)**"
"**ALLY INVEST - 4 DAY OUTAGE FOR MANY CUSTOMERS**

Hey everyone I just want to try and get some visibility here with what‚Äôs going on with Ally invest.

Ally bank has been used and recommended a lot over the years here on Reddit. Mainly for their savings accounts. A lot of people use their invest option for convenience and low fees.

Currently their investing/brokerage service is still down for many people and their customer service is being completely unresponsive.

My personal experience:

Thursday my cash balance of $16000 was wiped. Placed to $0. My Holdings were still present but any ability to purchase was removed by simply placing my cash balance to $0. 

It is now Saturday and 48hrs, 6 hours on phone hold, 4 chats, and 4 emails, and 1 SEC complaint, my account balance is still $0


They removed my ability to buy any stock, at all. I can only sell.

TL,DR

Ally invest is erasing cash balances in brokerage accounts. They use Apex for clearing.

**EDIT: Additional information - PLEASE UPVOTE**  

**-People are reporting that this is only happening to accounts that are holding restricted/meme stocks**

**-This is a widespread issue and is starting to pop up on different sites Twitter/Downdetector/ even attacking IG because there‚Äôs no means to get through to support**

**-Some accounts have been reverted to Tradeking from many years ago**

**-3 days many customers have had zero/minimal access to their assets through Ally Invest**

**EDIT 2:**

**-Day 4 everything still down**"

"Copied my comment from an earlier thread because I think it‚Äôs important for people to understand:

I Unsubbed from wsb today. Something doesn‚Äôt seem right there and the hive mind is out of control. Tons of noobs are gonna lose a lot of money because of the misinformation going on there. EVENTUALLY the squeeze will happen and the price will come crashing down. When that happens a lot of people are gonna be left holding the bag. The people who bought at 40$ will be fine and will still make out with good gains. But the people who are buying at 300 and even 400 are gonna be in a position where they have to time the market perfectly. Not everyone will be able to and those that entered at a high entry point will be left holding the bag when it inevitably does crash. Remember vw shot up to $1000 for like 20 minutes before it came crashing down to earth.

I know people here don‚Äôt like to hear it but this is the truth. People are gonna lose money off of this play. A lot of people will also make a ton of money. But if your thinking about buying on Monday understand that your gonna be in a position of having to time the market if you actually wanna make money.

Don‚Äôt listen to the populists trying to tell you to buy while at the same time telling you ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about the money it‚Äôs about sending a message‚Äù. That‚Äôs some populist bullshit. For most of us it is in fact about the money

Edit: I never said the squeeze lasted 20 minutes. I said the 1000$ price did. And it did. Look at the chart. It was at 1000$ for a super brief period and there was enormous sell off. It rapidly crashed the following days. My point still stands. People are acting like 1000$ is gonna be certain when in reality your gonna have to sell at the perfect time to be able to sell at 1000$. And if you are buying gme on the way up you will most certainly have to sell at the right time or be left with the bag."
IT'S A TARP!!!
"the whole financial services industry is now going to be put under a microscope. It's been an old boys club for a long time and now the scales have begun to tip the other way.

We've all been conditioned to expect NOTHING from them so far, so we'll see if anything changes."
"What? I just read a huge ass DD post on reddit here last week why Silver is the most shorted / manipulated thing ever. How the hell is that the medias fault reporting about all these 'squeeze Silver' posts here by redditors?

"You were naive, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to feel bad for yourself. The socioeconomic elite always have had the upper hand and always will, that‚Äôs just a fact of life (not just stocks). That doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt do well for yourself, it just means you‚Äôre more limited than some.

Those with wealth always have better resources than those who don‚Äôt and worse resources than those with more wealth, and it will stay that way. From access to information, brokers, and trades. 

As technology advances, those who have the best software and the fastest computers will be able to process news and make trades better and faster than someone without those resources can open an article and read the headline. 

Those with faster internet connections can make better trades than you. What happens if their order gets to market in a microsecond and yours takes a millisecond? You‚Äôre last in line. But you‚Äôre still in the line.

People will always scheme, plot, or have the upper-hand to you. But that won‚Äôt stop you from doing well. You can still do your DD and make smart decisions that give you financial gain. You just won‚Äôt beat the best of the best in a 1-to-1 competition.

"For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

 1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

 2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

 3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

 4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

 5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

 6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

 7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

 8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

 9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

You're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill."

"I put the following on the other sub, but I can share it here, too.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**  

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today."
" 

First of all, I want to start by saying that some hedge funds are shady fucks. There are a lot of things they did illegal. Here are a few examples:

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)

Now I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.

1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH they wanted to drive the price down!?**

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RHand other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren‚Äôt transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.

**2. But I was allowed to sell!**

Of course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.

**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**

Thinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.

**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**

Melvin already closed their position. There was enough volume for them to do so.

The short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.

Hedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.

Many hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.

**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**

It could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don‚Äôt get margin called, which I don‚Äôt expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let‚Äôs say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let‚Äôs say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.

Considering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.

**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**

A lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?

Well, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.

**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**

Sure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.

**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**

Citadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.

**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**

Not necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.

**TL;DR**

Hedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)

But many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not take from thin air. Because against hedge funds is good, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down. Knowing how markets work, and being vigilant is how you make more money than hedge funds."

The rich are desperate. They've been trying so hard to use their power to shut down the little guy from winning, yet all of their manipulation isn't working.

Let's be real. When this is over, not much will be different. The rich will probably get a slap on the wrist and keep going being as manipulative as before. The difference is that the whole world has seen what Wall Street is, and what we can do to them. Never be ashamed to be in the market, because the market is free because of you. The rich can't control us anymore."
"It‚Äôs not a trap. And Wallstreetbets was a huge campaign against it because NOW along with there ego has huge manufacturing giants and elites attached to it. They couldn‚Äôt stop GME but they can stop silver. It will effect them. Buying physical silver is the only way. This will bring to light the manipulation, the corruption, the false power certificates that are traded. And you think the shorts on stocks are a crime of collusion. Shorts on silver have been manipulated by the likes of JP Morgan and the rest. Controlling the ups and downs to profit billions of the shorts. Even fined 900 million for it last year but that‚Äôs nothing. They will take the fine happily. 
They call this a distraction. How is it a distraction. No one said sell GME. No one said don‚Äôt hold GME. This is just the second and last play. On a commodity that is undervalued illegally. And they are scared. Scared of there money, scared of real change. Scared of attention being brought away from there precious GME. Has nothing to do with them. Just figured if you are about taking down the elites. Exposing what‚Äôs been happing in the banking industry for decades. This is the way. You read the information then it clear. The smear against this is all fear. And that is good. We won‚Äôt stop. I like this metal. And I like this metal now. And it‚Äôs such common sense that if you claim to not see it. Then there are alternative motives to speak against it."
They removed AAL as well.
A higher level question is whether shorting stocks is valid. [Elon and Shorts](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/256450/20210128/elon-musk-calls-out-robinhood-bs-shorting-scam-stock-trading%E2%80%94only.htm)
"Here is what I will say.

Faber is a solid reporter. He always seems to be a black and white reporter of news. That being said, while he indicates that Melvin HAS closed, he has obviously talked to his sources and there are other hedge funds who are short that are going to need bailouts. Additionally, he highlights that while Melvin has closed their position who is still covering. He hit the nail on the head. Stay the course to Valhalla ladies and gentlemen."
MAIL THE PRESIDENT. CONTACT YOUR SENATORS. DO NOT STOP UNTIL THESE HEDGE FUNDS AND ROBINHOOD ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THE NASDAQ CEO SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR MARKET MANIPULATION AND FRAUD. THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEMS AND BIDEN TO STEP UP AND SHOW THEY REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. WE DEMAND ACTION.
